This paper covers the numerical solutions of a Penning trap. The Penning trap
helps confine charged particles with a magnetic field. In this report, we must
start with deriving the equations of motion, which we prove can be
a single differential equation.
Before we build the rest of the simulation, we derive the general solution with
corresponding upper and lower bounds.
Lastly, we look at the specific case of Ca$^+$ ions and how they would behave in
said Penning trap with the configurations $B_0 = 1.00$T, $V_0 = 25.0$mV and
$d = 500\si{\micro\meter}$.
We accomplish this with the help of object-oriented programming that handles the
different parts of this problem and combine them to achieve good results.
