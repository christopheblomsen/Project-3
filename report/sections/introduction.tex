Physical experiments often depend on the
possibility of isolating particles. Examples include experiments where we want to measure the mass or charge of the
trapped particles or collide the particles with
other particles to see what comes out. One way of isolating and
storing the particles, i.e. trapping them, is a Penning trap.

We want to study the physics of Penning traps using simulations of Ca$^+$-ions.
For many such particles, we will look into the effects of Coulomb interactions on the motion of the
particles in the trap.
Since the motion of the particles inside the trap is periodic, we can also find resonance
phenomena. The particles might be more susceptible to gaining energy
from the oscillating electric field for specific angular frequencies. We will look for
resonance frequencies for a Penning
trap and see how the Coulomb interactions effect the resonance.
